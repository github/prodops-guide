# ProdOps Guides

Community guides for software creators. **[Check it outâ€¦](http://prodops.guide/)**

## Goals

The goal of the ProdOps Guides is to provide teams, companies and organizations a framework to understand how software impacts business needs.  

Guides:
- Accuracy:
  - Did we build what our customer wanted?
  - Did we align our requirements with company goals?
- Utilization:
  - Did we leverage our developers to the best of our abilities?
  - Did we scope the work in a way that allows small, iterative releases?
  - Did we keep our team small enough to allow for effective collaboration?
- Precision:
  - Did the product perform to expected standards?
  - Did we minimize our technical debt?
  - Did we define tests before implementation began?
- Efficiency:
  - Did we create a flexible environment?
  - Did we create a scalable environment?
  - Did we create a secure environment?
