# Contributing to ProdOps Guides

Thanks for checking out the ProdOps Guides! We're excited to hear and learn from you. Your experiences will benefit others who read and use these guides.

We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful.

## Types of contributions we're looking for
First and foremost, this project is a forum to discuss ProdOps best practices, then document them in a guide when we've found consensus. Your first contribution might be starting a new conversation, or adding to an existing conversation, around best practices. You can do so under [Issues](https://github.com/github/prodops-guide/issues).

There are also many ways you can directly contribute to the guides:

* Fix editorial inconsistencies or inaccuracies
* Revise language to be more approachable and friendly
* Translate the guide into other languages
* Add links to other case studies or examples that help illustrate a point (either inline, or under "Further Reading")
* Write a new article (please open an issue to discuss before writing!)

Interested in making a contribution? Read on!

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* This guide is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/github/prodops-guide/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/github/prodops-guide/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, you can make the change and open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new article or case study, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Setting up your environment

This site is powered by [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com). Running it on your local machine requires a working [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installation with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

Once you have that set up, run:

    script/bootstrap
    script/server

â€¦and open http://localhost:4000 in your web browser.

## Contribution review process

This repo is currently maintained by @coryvj, @leefaus and @kingmichaelj, who have commit access. They will likely review your contribution.

While we enjoy maintaining this project and are excited that you want to participate, we have full-time jobs and competing priorities. If you haven't heard from anyone in 10 days, feel free to bump the thread or @-mention a maintainer to review your contribution.

If you've been active on this project (such as writing helpful content, answering others' questions, or triaging issues) and would like a more formal leadership role, open up an issue and let's talk about it!

## Community

Discussions about the ProdOps Guides take place on this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/github/prodops-guide/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/github/prodops-guide/pulls) sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations. There is also a [Slack Channel](
https://prodops-guide.slack.com) for regular updates.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
